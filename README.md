# msds699-final_project


Hello, my name is Sophie Wang and I'm receiving a Master's Degree in Data Science at University of San Francisco. This is the project I completed for a machine learning course.

## Project Description: Bank Churner Prediction

As a business owner, your priority is not only to acquire customers, but also to retain them. Besides trying your best developing the best product possible. Would you ever want to know who is going to leave your business before they actually do so? So you could proactively target them and take actions to reverse their decisions.

In this project, I completed the end-to-end machine learning workflow for an imbalanced dataset including:

1) EDA and visualization
2) Feature engineering 
3) Model selection with cross validation 
4) Evaluation metric on the winner model
5) Examine feature importance on the winner model
6) Winner Model web app deployment using Streamlit, the web app URL is [here](https://bank-churner.herokuapp.com/)

Winner model: Gradient Boosting
